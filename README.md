## Bamazon

Bamazon is a command line app that allows users to purchase products from the online store as a customer.  

The customer is presented with a table of the products populated from a database.

Customers are then prompted to enter the ID of the product they would like to purchase and the amount of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the application checks if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request. If not, the customer is informed and the app prevents the order from going through.

If the store has enough of the product, the customer's order is fulfilled.  The database table is updated after each transaction with the new quantity in stock. The total cost of the purchase is displayed.
